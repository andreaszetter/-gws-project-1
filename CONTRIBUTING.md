# Contributing to Our Game Project

Thanks for being part of this journey! Please refer to this text for reference when collaborating.

## How to Share Your Ideas

### 1. Quick Thoughts & Brainstorming

For raw ideas and brainstorming:

1. Open [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md)
2. Add your thoughts to the relevant section
3. Commit with a descriptive message like "Added idea on cool character idea"
4. Don't overthink it!

### 2. Detailed Concepts

For more developed ideas that need space:

1. Create a new file in the appropriate `docs/` subfolder
   - `docs/mechanics/` - Gameplay mechanics
   - `docs/narrative/` - Story, characters, world-building
   - `docs/technical/` - Tech decisions, tools, implementation ideas
2. Use a clear filename like `roguelike-combat-system.md`
3. Include as much or as little detail as you want

### 3. Building on Others' Ideas

- Add comments directly in the relevant markdown file
- Use quotes (`>`) to reference the original idea
- Add your thoughts below it
- Example:
  ```markdown
  > Original idea: A puzzle game about time manipulation
  
  Building on this - what if the puzzles also affect the music/sound?
  ```

## File Organization

```
docs/
├── mechanics/          # How the game plays
│   └── example-mechanic.md
├── narrative/          # Story and world
│   └── example-story.md
└── technical/          # Tech stuff
    └── example-tech.md
```

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Instead of "make it fun," try "add power-ups that create combo opportunities"
- **Be Open**: Others might adapt your ideas - that's collaboration!
- **Be Constructive**: Build on ideas rather than shooting them down
- **Be Yourself**: Your unique perspective is valuable

## What to Commit

**DO commit:**
- Ideas and concepts
- Design documents
- Sketches and diagrams (as images)
- References and inspirations
- Meeting notes or discussion summaries

**DON'T commit:**
- Large binary files without discussion
- Generated files or build artifacts
- AI-generated Slop
- Personal notes meant to stay private

## Getting Feedback

Want thoughts on an idea? 

1. Commit your idea to the repo
2. Let the team know (chat, meeting, etc.)
3. Give people time to read and think
4. Discuss together!

## Questions?

Just ask! We're all learning and creating together. Please reach out to one of us for clarification <3
