## How to Share Ideas

### 🌟 Option 1: Contribution Form (Recommended for Quick Ideas!)

**📝 [Submit Your Idea via Google Form](https://forms.google.com/)**

This is the **easiest way** to share your ideas:

✅ **No Git/GitHub knowledge needed**  
✅ **Takes just a few minutes**

✅ **Structured format** helps capture all details  

**How it works:**

### 💻 Option 2: Direct Repository Editing (For Git Users)

#### 1. Quick Thoughts & Brainstorming

For raw ideas and brainstorming:

1. Open [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md)
2. Add your thoughts to the relevant section
3. Commit with a descriptive message like "Add idea about puzzle mechanics"
4. No need to overthink it - rough ideas are perfect!

#### 2. Detailed Concepts

For more developed ideas that need space:

1. Create a new file in the appropriate `docs/` subfolder
   - `docs/mechanics/` - Gameplay mechanics
   - `docs/narrative/` - Story, characters, world-building
   - `docs/technical/` - Tech decisions, tools, implementation ideas
2. Use a clear filename like `roguelike-combat-system.md`
3. Include as much or as little detail as you want

#### 3. Building on Others' Ideas

- Add comments directly in the relevant markdown file
- Use quotes (`>`) to reference the original idea
- Add your thoughts below it
- Example:
  ```markdown
  > Original idea: A puzzle game about time manipulation
  
  Building on this - what if the puzzles also affect the music/sound?
  ```

## File Organization

```
docs/
├── mechanics/          # How the game plays
│   └── example-mechanic.md
├── narrative/          # Story and world
│   └── example-story.md
└── technical/          # Tech stuff
    └── example-tech.md
```

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Instead of "make it fun," try "add power-ups that create combo opportunities"
- **Be Open**: Others might adapt your ideas - that's collaboration!
- **Be Constructive**: Build on ideas rather than shooting them down
- **Be Yourself**: Your unique perspective is valuable

## What to Commit

✅ **DO commit:**
- Ideas and concepts
- Design documents
- Sketches and diagrams (as images)
- References and inspirations
- Meeting notes or discussion summaries

❌ **DON'T commit:**
- Large binary files without discussion
- Generated files or build artifacts
- Personal notes meant to stay private

## Getting Feedback

Want thoughts on an idea? 

1. Commit your idea to the repo
2. Let the team know (chat, meeting, etc.)
3. Give people time to read and think
4. Discuss together!

## Questions?

Just ask! We're all learning and creating together.
