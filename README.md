# Game Workshop Space - Project 1

Welcome to our ideas page! 🎮

## Purpose

This repository is a creative workspace for us to share ideas, thoughts, and concepts for our game project. While we haven't settled on the exact direction yet, this space serves as:

- A central hub for brainstorming game concepts
- A place to document our thoughts and inspirations
- A collaborative environment to evolve our ideas together
- A foundation for our future prototyping
