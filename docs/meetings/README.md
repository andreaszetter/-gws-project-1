# Meeting Notes & Discussions

This folder is for keeping track of our conversations, decisions, and progress.

## How to Use This

After each discussion or meeting:

1. Create a new file with the date: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
2. Document what you discussed
3. Note any decisions made
4. Add action items or next steps
